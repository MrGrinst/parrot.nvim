# parrot.nvim ü¶ú

This is [parrot.nvim](https://github.com/frankroeder/parrot.nvim), the ultimate [stochastic parrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot) to support your text editing inside Neovim.

> [!NOTE]‚ö†Ô∏è
> This repository is still a work in progress, as large parts of the code are still being simplified and restructured.
> It is based on the brilliant work [gp.nvim](https://github.com/Robitx/gp.nvim) by https://github.com/Robitx.

Currently, we support the following providers:
+ [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/api) for Claude-3 ‚ùó
+ [perplexity.ai API](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api)
+ [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)
+ Local and offline serving via [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

I started this repository because a perplexity subscription provides $5 of API credits every month for free.
Instead of letting them go to waste, I modified my favorite GPT plugin, [gp.nvim](https://github.com/Robitx/gp.nvim), to meet my needs - a new Neovim plugin was born! üî•

## Demo

Seamlessly switch between providers and agents.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- [`neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases)
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [`plenary`](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

### lazy.nvim
```lua
{
  "frankroeder/parrot.nvim",
  dependencies = { "fzf-lua", "plenary" },
  config = function()
    require("parrot").setup {
      providers = {
        pplx = {
          api_key = os.getenv "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY",
          -- OPTIONAL
          -- gpg command
          -- api_key = { "gpg", "--decrypt", vim.fn.expand("$HOME") .. "/pplx_api_key.txt.gpg"  },
          -- macOS security tool
          -- api_key = { "/usr/bin/security", "find-generic-password", "-s pplx-api-key", "-w" },
        },
        openai = {
          api_key = os.getenv "OPENAI_API_KEY",
        },
        anthropic = {
          api_key = os.getenv "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
        },
      },
    }
  end,
}
```

## Configuration

### For now, refer to my personal lazy.nvim setup for custom hooks and key bindings.
https://github.com/frankroeder/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/lua/plugins/parrot.lua

## Adding a new agents

We provide two types of agents that might need different system prompts and API parameters.
To make a new chat agent available, one simply adds a new entry to the list `chat` or to `command`, respectively.

```lua
require("parrot").setup {
    -- ...
    agents = {
        chat = {
          {
              name = "CodeLlama",
              model = { model = "codellama", temperature = 1.5, top_p = 1, num_ctx = 8192, min_p = 0.05 },
              system_prompt = "Help me!",
              provider = "ollama",
          }
        }
    },
    -- ...
}
```

## Commands

Below are the available commands that can be configured as keybindings.
These commands are included in the default setup.
Additional useful commands are implemented through hooks (see my example configuration).

### Adding a new command

WIP

```lua
require("parrot").setup {
    -- ...
    hooks = {
      -- PrtAsk simply ask a question that should be answered short and precisely.
      Ask = function(parrot, params)
            local template = [[
            In light of your existing knowledge base, please generate a response that
            is succinct and directly addresses the question posed. Prioritize accuracy
            and relevance in your answer, drawing upon the most recent information
            available to you. Aim to deliver your response in a concise manner,
            focusing on the essence of the inquiry.
            Question: {{command}}
            ]]
            local agent = parrot.get_command_agent()
            parrot.logger.info("Asking agent: " .. agent.name)
            parrot.Prompt(params, parrot.ui.Target.popup, "ü§ñ Ask ~ ", agent.model, template, "", agent.provider)
      end,
    }
    -- ...
}
```


## Known Issues

- In case of a corrupted state, simply remove the file `~/.local/share/nvim/parrot/persisted/state.json`
